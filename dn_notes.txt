We need to create a page that will load all of the thingies

Three main sections of the site
Navigation on the top
Sections with Pages right be low
Page Canvas where you edit the currently selected page which takes up the rest of the screen.

Class Sections - 
  - Hidden Scrollable Horizontal (did similar thing for work.)
  - Sortable (JQuery) that has a vertical bound if possible (so we can only move them horizontally and not all over the page)
  - Hideable sections. 
  - Arrow for editing?

Pages - 
  - Double click to open that page. 
  - If we change section area, then ask user if this is what we really plan on doing.

Page Canvas -
  - This outer div will be the constraints for all entries.
  - For now will default this at some specific size (not adjustable at the moment)
  - Need option to be in edit / view modes.
Entry -
  - Each entry has a picture and text
  - The text overlays the picture only when the user requires
  - Entries are resizable (JQuery)
  - Entries are Draggable (with in the constraints of the Page Canvas)

  To display the page canvas, it should really just be the page ID grabbing all the data that it needs.

  SHOW PAGE: Should show the page the way we need it to.

  PAGE_CANVAS will be a new model

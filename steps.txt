STEPS I NEED TO DO.

User get to front screen
 - Do we have a current user?
 - YES? LOAD user information with Page Canvas with current page from session
 - NO? Log in 
    - User Name is all that's required, store the user ID in session

Just logged in ? 
 - Have the entire page displayed 
 - Ajax requests required probably.


Currently working on just the canvas area. It is the most important, and we need to have it at least somewhat presentable.

Next steps:
Completed 90% of the scroller. It now needs to actually delete and scroll horizontally properly without the scroll bar (which should be just adding javascript)


NEW!!!
	! We need to finish the seed.rb so that it adds all of the images into the database
		- Seed should be able to create a new entry with the tex for those pages
		- Seed adds all of the images (should do that currently) to the database
	! Change log in screen and if logged out to redirect
	! Need to change seed.rb to actually add entries to the initial pages.
	! Need to add the images as well.
	! Create home page
	- Change add section to be inline (so that it's a text input with an okay button)
	- Add the create new class to the rendered page so we are not ajax calling it
	- Add capabilities to move a note from one page to another by having them draggable to a target.
		- We need to see if we can actually do this.


Images
First level is class, second level is section, third level is a note. When we add it to the database we don't care about the note level except when writing the it.
